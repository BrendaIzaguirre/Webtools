         <dt id="7">If she hadn't been an actor, White would have been a zookeeper.</dt>
         <dd>"Hands down," she confessed in a 2014 interview. This should come as little surprise to those aware of White's reputation as an avid animal lover and activist. Not only did she try to visit the local zoo of wherever she traveled, but she was also a supporter of the Farm Animal Reform Movement and Friends of Animals group, as well as a Los Angeles Zoo board member, who donated "tens of thousands of dollars" over the past several decades. In 2010, White founded a T-shirt line whose profits go to the Morris Animal Foundation, one of her most beloved charities. </dd>
